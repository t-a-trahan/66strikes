From 1962 to 1965, the Labor Relations staff attached to US Army Mobility Command (MOCOM), based at the Detroit Tank Arsenal in Warren, Michigan, kept scattered, mostly handwritten records of the few dozen work stoppages that military contractors were required to report. Then, in 1966, strike activity inside military contractors plants exploded, producing enough reports - now standardized through a special form label DD-1507: Work Stoppage Report - to fill an entire US National Archives FRC box.

The picture looking out from the DTA Labor Relations staff records stands in sharp contrast to existing official statistics on labor militancy in the defense industry.Under "Ordnance and accessories" (read: military industry), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Work Stoppage Analysis for the year 1966 counts only thirteen strikes involving 8680 workers who idled for a total of 62,500 days. The documents analyzed in this data, which were generated by the Labor Relations staff at the Detroit Tank Arsenal (DTA) in that same year, tell a very different story: almost ten times as many strikes in military industrial plants, involving over five times as many workers, who cost their employers at least 790,000 worker-days. 

These DTA records provide only a partial scan of the whole body of military industry in the year 1966. DTA Labor Relations staff reporting on work stoppages focused almost exclusively on contracts overseen by the staff's parent agency, MOCOM. We rarely glimpse occurrences of labor unrest affecting contracts overseen by other Army commands, much less other branches of the US military. That said, MOCOM oversaw contracts for a number of big-ticket conventional hardware, like the M60 tank, the M109 self-propelled howitzer, and M110 armored personnel carrier, as well as many smaller but still important items, like trucks, shop vans, and the small horse-power engines used as generators to run AC in tropical Southeast Asia. This scan may be incomplete, but it captures vital organs of military industry, and its gaps merely point beyond itself to an even wider discrepancy between BLS data and the actual reality of shopfloor conflicts brought to boil by the intensification of US military involvement in the Vietnam War. The total number of strikes, strikers, and production days lost likely to be much higher than what is recorded in this document.

The stakes of this discrepancy between BLS data and DTA records are much deeper than simple accurate account; it matters for our understanding of how the United States' long, brutal, and industrially intense war in Southeast Asia shaped political-economic and social relations on its own soil. We know that the United States turned Southeast Asia into the most bombed region on the planet, dropping more bombs at a faster rate, than it used across all theatres of the Second World War. But we do not yet know enough about <em>how</em> all this materiel was made, <em>who</em> made it, and <em>what effects</em> its production had on social reality during a disavowed war with a disavowed home front.

```

How the above value is calculated: (sum of days lost to strike) / [(sum of strikes) * 365)]*100. This slightly over estimates percentage of productivity days lost because it double counts a small number of factories (N= ~4) that featured multiple strikes and assumes that every factory operated 365 days a year.

* continue cleaning up data manually
* clean up cities
* PDF friendly maps
* clean up state column
