By this we mean the transfer and elibility of employees from one department to another or from one plant to another .They nevertheless retained teh same type of a local contract for their M&R shops.""; ""The company manufactures electronic tubes used by the government's various agencies. These orders constitute approximately 50% of their production capacity. There were a total of 9600 mandays lost, of which approximately 4800 were on government contracts."" 

11/15 Narrative - ""the strike continues at this plant and even though the IBEW reached a national agreement at Pittsburgh, apparently the officers of local IBEW 1833, Elmire, N.Y. are in disagreement with the naitonal settlement to the extent where they prefer a union shop and not the accumulative service time as agreed upon. They also want assurance that there will be no discremination against any union member because of their participation in the strike.  2. Nevertheless, the union is submitting to its rank and file the national agreement with some local issues included which have already been negotiated for approval the afternoon of 15 November 1966. 3. It is the opinion of the CIRS that the rank and file will accept the proposal as submitted and agreed upon at the national level. Because of previous observations we feel as though the majority of the rank and file were not interested in a strike at this time and are somewhat anxious to return to work. [...] Removed materials 10 Nov - 15 cartso n tubes. If strike continues, will need to make similar removal ""within a week or ten days time.; Thye union is very cooperative in allowing shipment of vital government material.""

11/7 Narrative - ""the IBEW nationally struck the Westinghouse facilities officially on 1 Nov 1966. However, Westinghouse, Elmire plant did not go out until 3 Nov 1966. They had previously agreed to work on a day to day basis only to have another union, namely the American Flint Glass WOrkers representing the workers at the Westinghouse plant in Bath, N.Y., some 37 miles from Elmire, picket the Elmira facility and soliciting the IBEW local to honor said picket line. The CIRS is of the opinion that the rank and file voted to make their honoring of the Glass Workers picket line official, therfore struck of their own accord."" ""The company devotes approximately 50% of their production effort on government orders. Attached order board if or infomration only, and in the event of needed clarification, the CIRS, Rochester, N.Y. should be contacted."" 

order board - looks like order board but different; lists as many or more DOD departments as it does contractors.

11/8 WSJ clipping ""Westinghouse, Striking Union Heed U.S. Plea - ""Defense Output Called Hurt""; ""The IBEW struck at midnight Oct. 31 when its natioanl contract expired. The contract only covered 800 workers in 22 repair shops that service Westinghouse-built equipment. IBEW members at 11 manufactuing plants also have joined the strike, and two others have been shut by roving IBEW pickets.  Altogether, Westinghouse says 8318 IBEW members are on strike and 436 are staying out becuase of pickets. A key issue in the negotiations has been the union's demand that the national contract cover all plants where it has memebrs. It has 14,000 members among Westinghouse employees, most of them at 24 manufactuing plants. IBEW units at these plants currently bargain individually for plant-level contracts only."" The IBEW was an original member of an AFL-CIO effort at so-called 'coordinated bargaining' in the electrical industry this year. All AFL-CIO unions which had contracts with Westinghouse or General Electric Corp. banded together to support one another in bargaining. The group began with eight uniosn and later grew to 11 when negotiations with General Electric got tougher last month. Eventually, all uniosn which had national contracts with the two companies settled except the IBEW with Westinghouse. Geogre Meany, president of the AFL-CIO called a meeting of the heads of the 11 unions last week to discuss the Westinghouse situation. Afterward, he issued a statement pledging support to the IBEW. Beside the IBEW work stoppages, Westinghouse said it has a total of 6,240 members of other uniosn on strike at four other plants over other issues.""
